# Combine-Signals-for-Enhanced-Alpha-with-Random-Forest-for-Trading

### Overview:
In this project, we combined signals on a random forest for enhanced alpha. While implementing this, we solved the problem of overlapping samples. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.

Alpha is a metric used to gauge the outperformance of a trading portfolio over a normalised portfolio. It is one of modern portfolio theoryâ€™s statistical measures used to quantify the returns made from an investment against a benchmark. The better the alpha value, the better an investment performed against market indices.

### Requirements:
Python 3.x
